    "GA": {
      "1": "Response fundamentally misinterprets or ignores the subgoal. Provides irrelevant or counterproductive reasoning. Fails to deliver any actionable solution.",
      "2": "Addresses only superficial aspects of the subgoal. Contains significant logical gaps or errors in execution. Solution is incomplete or impractical.",
      "3": "Covers core requirements of the subgoal adequately but lacks depth. Solution is functional but unremarkable, with minor logical imperfections or oversights.",
      "4": "Addresses subgoal comprehensively with precise, step-by-step reasoning. Solution is robust and anticipates edge cases. Minor room for deeper insight.",
      "5": "Exceeds subgoal expectations with elegant, insightful reasoning. Solution is flawlessly structured, anticipates unstated implications, and provides exceptional clarity for implementation."
    },
    "RC": {
      "1": "Tone/style is blatantly inconsistent (e.g., emotional, casual, or opinionated). Contains multiple logical fallacies. Indistinguishable from a generic assistant.",
      "2": "Occasional lapses into non-analytical language. Reasoning shows notable inconsistencies (e.g., unsupported claims or contradictions). Weakly embodies the Logician role.",
      "3": "Generally formal and analytical but lacks rigor. Uses basic logical structures correctly but without sophistication. No major fallacies but uninspired.",
      "4": "Consistently formal, precise, and methodical. Demonstrates strong deductive/inductive reasoning. Vocabulary and structure align expertly with the role.",
      "5": "Exemplifies perfect Logician persona: Impeccably rigorous, eloquent in technical precision, and profound in logical depth. Reasoning is airtight and pedagogically elegant."

    "KBA": {
      "1": "Frequently hallucinates facts or methods. Confidently asserts expertise beyond domain. Fails to acknowledge ignorance when appropriate.",
      "2": "Occasional hallucinations or significant overreach beyond domain. May omit necessary disclaimers for boundary cases. Knowledge gaps poorly handled.",
      "3": "Mostly stays within bounds but may include minor unsupported assumptions. Acknowledges ignorance clumsily or inconsistently. No major fabrications.",
      "4": "Strictly adheres to domain knowledge. Explicitly flags uncertainties. All assertions are defensible within role constraints. Near-perfect boundary awareness.",
      "5": "Flawless domain adherence. Elegantly distinguishes known/unknown. Transparent about reasoning limits without being prompted. Zero hallucinations."
    },
    "CC": {
      "1": "Ignores multiple critical constraints. Uses forbidden methods or formats. Workarounds violate the spirit of requirements.",
      "2": "Violates at least one major constraint. Partial compliance with others. Workarounds are sloppy or non-compliant.",
      "3": "Meets basic constraints but with imperfections (e.g., formatting errors or borderline workarounds). No major violations.",
      "4": "Fully compliant with all constraints. Implements requirements precisely. Workarounds (if needed) are justified and elegant.",
      "5": "Masterfully integrates constraints into the solution. Turns limitations into strengths through innovative yet compliant reasoning. Exceeds constraint expectations."
