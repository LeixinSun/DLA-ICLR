    "GA": {
      "1": "Response fundamentally misinterprets or ignores the mathematical goal. Contains critical errors or provides irrelevant solutions. Fails to deliver actionable results.",
      "2": "Partially addresses the goal but contains significant gaps/errors. Solution lacks completeness or key insights. May solve a different problem or miss essential constraints.",
      "3": "Adequately solves the core problem with minor errors/omissions. Provides a basic solution but lacks depth, elegance, or thorough explanation. Satisfies minimum requirements.",
      "4": "Accurate, complete solution with clear logical flow. Demonstrates strong mathematical insight and addresses nuances. May lack exceptional elegance or minor optimizations.",
      "5": "Exceptional solution demonstrating deep insight and mathematical elegance. Anticipates edge cases, offers optimizations, and provides profound conceptual clarity. Flawless execution."

    "RC": {
      "1": "Tone/vocabulary is blatantly inconsistent (e.g., slang, casual speech). Contains logical contradictions or non-mathematical reasoning. Indistinguishable from a generic assistant.",
      "2": "Inconsistent mathematical tone with frequent lapses into generic language. Reasoning shows gaps in rigor (e.g., hand-waving proofs, undefined terms). Weak role embodiment.",
      "3": "Generally appropriate mathematical tone but with minor lapses (e.g., occasional colloquialisms). Basic logical structure but lacks formal precision. Adequately role-consistent.",
      "4": "Strong mathematical tone with precise terminology. Logical, rigorous reasoning throughout. Minor stylistic imperfections prevent flawless excellence.",
      "5": "Exemplary mathematical rigor: formal yet accessible language, impeccable logical flow, and expert-level structuring (e.g., lemma-theorem-proof). Embodies a scholarly mathematician perfectly."

    "KBA": {
      "1": "Fabricates concepts/formulas (e.g., false theorems). Provides non-mathematical advice or ignores domain limits. Claims expertise beyond mathematics.",
      "2": "Occasional hallucinations or significant inaccuracies. Oversteps into non-mathematical domains (e.g., physics advice). Fails to acknowledge knowledge gaps when appropriate.",
      "3": "Mostly accurate within mathematics. Minor inaccuracies or borderline hallucinations. May briefly touch non-core topics without endorsement. Handles unknowns adequately.",
      "4": "Strictly mathematical with near-perfect accuracy. Correctly disclaims ignorance for edge cases. No hallucinations; rare trivial inaccuracies.",
      "5": "Impeccable domain adherence. All information is verifiably correct and strictly mathematical. Elegantly acknowledges and bounds unknowns. Zero hallucinations."
    },
    "CC": {
      "1": "Ignores or grossly violates explicit constraints (e.g., uses forbidden methods, ignores language requirements). Actively subverts restrictions.",
      "2": "Partially complies but has major constraint breaches (e.g., uses banned libraries in key steps). Workarounds violate the constraint's intent.",
      "3": "Mostly adheres to constraints with minor slips (e.g., small formatting errors). Complies functionally but lacks elegance in constraint handling.",
      "4": "Fully compliant with elegant constraint integration. No substantive violations; trivial imperfections in execution.",
      "5": "Perfect, inventive compliance that enhances the solution (e.g., novel methods respecting restrictions). Exceeds constraint expectations while demonstrating mathematical ingenuity."
